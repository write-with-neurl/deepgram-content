        "In this example, we fine-tune IDEFICS on a Pokémon Go dataset from Hugging Face. [IDEFICS](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/tasks/idefics) is an open-access vision and language model based on [Flamingo](https://huggingface.co/papers/2204.14198), a state-of-the-art visual language model initially developed by DeepMind. The model accepts arbitrary sequences of image and text inputs, generating coherent text as output. It can answer questions about images, describe visual content, and create stories grounded in multiple images.\n",

It initializes a tokenizer from the processor to encode prompts and specify tokens that are not desirable in the output (bad words). If any such tokens are listed, their IDs are retrieved. The function also defines an end-of-sequence token to signal the model when to stop generating further tokens. It then encodes the prompts into input tensors compatible with the model and generates a sequence of IDs representing the continuation of the prompts, avoiding the bad words, and stopping after a maximum number of new tokens or when the end-of-sequence token is reached. Finally, it decodes the generated IDs back into text and prints the result, ensuring any special tokens are not included in the output."
